# Door System
Simple door ownership system that works on any gamemode.

## Current Features:
<ul>
	<li>Own doors by looking at them and pressing F2.</li>
	<li>Owned doors can be locked and unlocked with the keys.</li>
	<li>Locked doors can be forced open with the door ram.</li>
	<li>Admins can access a config in the F2 to force an owner on a door.</li>
	<li>Specific owner restrictions can be configured in the doors_config.lua file.</li>
	<li>Owner restrictions will save in a JSON file for each map.</li>
</ul>

## Note:
If you use this on DarkRP you'll have to disable the built-in door system for that gamemode. They shouldn't conflict with each other but the HUD elements will overlap.
